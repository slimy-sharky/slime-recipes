# Crosslinking agents
Crosslinking agents are the essential components that transform a liquid polymer base into the cohesive, elastic material we know as slime. By facilitating chemical bonds between individual polymer chains, these agents create a three-dimensional network that provides structural integrity and unique tactile properties. The degree of crosslinking directly determines the final texture—ranging from soft and gooey to firm and rubbery—making them the most critical factor in controlling the slime's consistency.

## Borax
Borax is an essential material for making elastic slime.
When it's dissolved in water, it generates borate ions, hydroxide ions, and other substances.
Borate ions form hydrogen bonds with the numerous hydroxyl groups in PVA, and this creates the unique flexibility of slime.

Since hydroxide ions promote the generation of borate ions, we can create many cross-linked structures with small amount of borax.

## Boric Acid
Boric acid is an acidic substance.
When it's dissolved in water, it produces borate ions, but the acidic solution doesn't produce sufficient borate ions for slime formation.
Therefore, we need to make the solution basic by adding a base such as sodium bicarbonate.
