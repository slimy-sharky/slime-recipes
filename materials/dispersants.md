# Dispersants
Dispersants are additives used to ensure a smooth and homogeneous consistency by preventing particles from clumping together. Their primary role is to stabilize the mixture and allow various components—such as pigments, fillers, or starches—to be distributed uniformly throughout the polymer bese. Dextrin is a prime example of a dispersant used in slime-making; it helps refine the texture and control the flow characteristics by reducing the internal friction between particles. This ensures that the final product remains stable and free from unwanted aggregation over time.

## Dextrin / Maltodextrin
Dextrin is a substance produced by hydrolyzing starch and is used as a dispersing agent.
The degree of starch decomposition is expressed by an indicator called Dextrose Equivalent (DE), which is a relative scale indicating the extent of starch hydrolysis, with dextrose (glucose) assigned a value of 100.
Dextrin typically has a DE value ranging from approximately 5 to 20, and dextrin in this range is called maltodextrin.
