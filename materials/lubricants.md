# Lubricants
Lubricants are incorporated into slime formulations to reduce internal friction and enhance the overall tactile experience. Their primary function is to improve the slip of the material, making the slime feel smooother to the touch and easier to stretch without tearing. By coating the polymer chains, lubricants prevent the mixture from becoming tacky or sticking to the skin. Sodium polyacrylate is representative example of such agents; they are highly effective at providing slip and adjusting the stringiness of the texture.

## Sodium Polyacrylate
Sodium polyacrylate is a superabsorbent polymer used as lubricant that forms thick film.
It's very common in Japan as a lubricant, so it's easy to get it if you live in Japan.
When it's hydrated, it becomes a gel-like substance and reduces the stickiness of slime.

## PEO (Polyethylene Oxide)
PEO has various uses depending on its molecular weight.
Low molecular weight PEO is used as a moisturizer, while high molecular weight PEO is used as a lubricant.
The film it creates is relatively thin, so it has little effect on the slime's stickiness.

## Xanthan Gum
Xanthan gum is a polysaccharide used as a lubricant that forms a thin film.
It is resistant to heat and pH changes, so it can be used even when heating is required.
It has a stringy texture and helps improve the slime's appearance.
Xanthan gum has a synergistic effect with guar gum, and they show maximum effect at a 1:4 ratio.

## CMC (Carboxymethyl Cellulose)
CMC acts as a thickening agent and increases viscosity of the slime.
Unlike guar gum, it hardly reacts with borate ions, and when it's dissolved in water, the solution remains clear.
