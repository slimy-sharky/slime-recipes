# Polymers
Polymers are the fundamental building blocks of slime, consisting of long, chain-like molecules made up of repeating structural units. In the context of slime-making, Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) is the most essential polymer, acting as the main backbone of the mixture. These long PVA chains are naturally flexible and can slide past each other, which gives the initial glue its liquid state. When these chains interact with other additives, they form the foundation of the slime's texture, providing the necessary elasticity and film-forming capabilities that allow the material to stretch and hold its shape.

## PVA (Polyvinyl Alcohol)
PVA is a water-soluble synthetic polymer commonly used in slime recipes.
It's produced by the hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate.
When it's mixed with borax, the hydroxyl groups on PVA bind with borate ions, and create a three-dimensional network that gives stretchy texture like slime.

## PVAc (Polyvinyl Acetate)
PVAc is the primary ingredient in white craft glue, and one of the most accessible materials for making slime.
Commercially available PVAc is sold in emulsified state with water and it's partially hydrolyzed, so we can use it as a substitute for PVA, but it has a strong acetic acid odor because it has many acetate groups.

## Guar Gum
Guar gum acts as a thickening agent and increases viscosity of the slime.
It also forms weak cross-links with borate ions through its hydroxyl groups.
It has a sweet smell, and when it's dissolved in water, the water turns a light yellow.

## Starch
Starch is a polymer composed of many glucose molecules.
The properties of starch vary depending on the ratio of amylose to amylopectin, particle size, and crystalline structure, so starch properties differ among plant species.

### Potato Starch
Potato starch has high viscosity and a thick consistency. It's suitable for making slime glossy because of its high transparency.

### Tapioca Starch
Tapioca starch has high viscosity and creates a chewy texture.
The chewy texture remains even after cooling.
It also has high transparency like potato starch, but has lower consistency.

### Glutinous rice starch
Glutinous rice starch has very strong stickiness and creates a chewy texture like tapioca starch.
When it's dissolved in water, the water turns white.
