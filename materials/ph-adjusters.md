# pH adjusters
pH adjusters are used to regulate the acidity or alkalinity of the slime solution. This control is vital because the efficiency of certain crosslinking agents, such as borax, depends heavily on the mixture's pH level. Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is a representative example; it creates a mildly alkaline environment that stabilizes the chemical reaction and helps optimize the thickening process. By maintaining the proper pH balance, the consistency of the slime becomes more predictable and the final product remains safe for handling.

## Sodium Bicarbonate
Sodium bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda, is an alkaline agent that helps increase the concentration of borate ions in the slime mixture. Because it has a relatively low pH compared to other adjusters, it is particularly suited for providing the slime with a moderate degree of firmness and a well-balanced consistency.

## Sodium sesquicarbonate
Sodium sesquicarbonate also serves to raise the pH level, facilitating a more efficient crosslinking reaction. Since it possesses a higher pH than sodium bicarbonate, it is highly effective at enhancing the preservation and long-term stability of the slime. Using this agent helps maintain the product's quality and extends its shelf-life by ensuring a more robust alkaline environment.
