# Plasticizers
Plasticizers are additives used to increase the flexibility and durability of the slime by making the polymer network less brittle. They work by embedding themselves between the polymer chains, increasing the free volume and allowing the chains to slide over one another more easily. Glycerin is the most widely recognized plasticizer in slime-making; it acts as a humectant that retains moisture while providing a soft, supple texture. By incorporating a plasticizer, the slime becomes more extensible and maintains its elastic properties over a longer period.

## Glycerin / PG (Propylene Glycol)
Glycerin and PG act as plasticizers because they have lower molecular weight and fewer hydroxyl groups compared to PVA or guar gum.
They are commonly used as moisturizers in cosmetics, so they also help prevent skin dryness during slime handling.

## Glucose
Glucose is a substance produced when starch is completely hydrolyzed.
It has a very low molecular weight and can be used as a plasticizer for slime.
It's highly soluble in water and can be used in powder form.
