# Materials of slime
## Introduction
Slime is a soft, stretchy, often brightly colored substance with a gel-like consistency that can be squeezed and stretched.
The creation of slime involves the interaction between polymers and cross-linking agents.
It makes elastic substance that not only flows like a liquid but also behaves like a solid.

This article introduces the materials for making slime.

## PVA (Polyvinyl Alcohol)
Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a water-soluble synthetic polymer commonly used in slime recipes.
It's produced by the hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate.
When it's mixed with borax, the hydroxyl groups on PVA bind with borate ions, and create a three-dimensional network that gives stretchy texture like slime.

## PVAc (Polyvinyl Acetate)
Polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) is the primary ingredient in white craft glue, and one of the most accessible materials for making slime.
Commercially available PVAc is sold in emulsified state with water and it's partially hydrolyzed, so we can use it as a substitute for PVA, but it has a strong acetic acid odor because it has many acetate groups.

## Borax
Borax is an essential material for making elastic slime.
When it's dissolved in water, it generates borate ions, hydroxide ions, and other substances.
Borate ions form hydrogen bonds with the numerous hydroxyl groups in PVA, and this creates the unique flexibility of slime.

Since hydroxide ions promote the generation of borate ions, we can create many cross-linked structures with small amount of borax.
