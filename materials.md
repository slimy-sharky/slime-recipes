# Materials of slime
## Introduction
Slime is a soft, stretchy, often brightly colored substance with a gel-like consistency that can be squeezed and stretched.
The creation of slime involves the interaction between polymers and cross-linking agents.
It makes elastic substance that not only flows like a liquid but also behaves like a solid.

This article introduces the materials for making slime.

## PVA (Polyvinyl Alcohol)
PVA is a water-soluble synthetic polymer commonly used in slime recipes.
It's produced by the hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate.
When it's mixed with borax, the hydroxyl groups on PVA bind with borate ions, and create a three-dimensional network that gives stretchy texture like slime.

## PVAc (Polyvinyl Acetate)
PVAc is the primary ingredient in white craft glue, and one of the most accessible materials for making slime.
Commercially available PVAc is sold in emulsified state with water and it's partially hydrolyzed, so we can use it as a substitute for PVA, but it has a strong acetic acid odor because it has many acetate groups.

## Borax
Borax is an essential material for making elastic slime.
When it's dissolved in water, it generates borate ions, hydroxide ions, and other substances.
Borate ions form hydrogen bonds with the numerous hydroxyl groups in PVA, and this creates the unique flexibility of slime.

Since hydroxide ions promote the generation of borate ions, we can create many cross-linked structures with small amount of borax.

## Boric Acid and Sodium Bicarbonate
Boric acid is an acidic substance.
When it's dissolved in water, it produces borate ions, but the acidic solution doesn't produce sufficient borate ions for slime formation.
Therefore, we need to make the solution basic by adding a base such as sodium bicarbonate.


## Guar Gum
Guar gum acts as a thickening agent and increases viscosity of the slime.
It also forms weak cross-links with borate ions through its hydroxyl groups.
It has a sweet smell, and when it's dissolved in water, the water turns a light yellow.

## CMC (Carboxymethyl Cellulose)
CMC acts as a thickening agent and increases viscosity of the slime.
Unlike guar gum, it hardly reacts with borate ions, and when it's dissolved in water, the solution remains clear.

## Glycerol / PG (Propylene Glycol)
Glycerol and PG act as plasticizers because they have lower molecular weight and fewer hydroxyl groups compared to PVA or guar gum.
They are commonly used as moisturizers in cosmetics, so they also help prevent skin dryness during slime handling.

## Sodium Polyacrylate
Sodium polyacrylate is a superabsorbent polymer used as lubricant that forms thick film.
It's very common in Japan as a lubricant, so it's easy to get it if you live in Japan.
When it's hydrated, it becomes a gel-like substance and reduces the stickiness of slime.

## PEO (Polyethylene Oxide)
PEO has various uses depending on its molecular weight.
Low molecular weight PEO is used as a moisturizer, while high molecular weight PEO is used as a lubricant.
The film it creates is relatively thin, so it has little effect on the slime's stickiness.

## Xanthan Gum
Xanthan gum is a polysaccharide used as a lubricant that forms a thin film.
It is resistant to heat and pH changes, so it can be used even when heating is required.
It has a stringy texture and helps improve the slime's appearance.
Xanthan gum has a synergistic effect with guar gum, and they show maximum effect at a 1:4 ratio.

## Starch
Starch is a polymer composed of many glucose molecules.
The properties of starch vary depending on the ratio of amylose to amylopectin, particle size, and crystalline structure, so starch properties differ among plant species.

### Potato Starch
Potato starch has high viscosity and a thick consistency. It's suitable for making slime glossy because of its high transparency.

### Tapioca Starch
Tapioca starch has high viscosity and creates a chewy texture.
The chewy texture remains even after cooling.
It also has high transparency like potato starch, but has lower consistency.

### Glutinous rice starch
Glutinous rice starch has very strong stickiness and creates a chewy texture like tapioca starch.
When it's dissolved in water, the water turns white.
