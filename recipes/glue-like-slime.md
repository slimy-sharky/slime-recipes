# Glue-like slime
Glue is a sticky, gooey liquid that stretches well. Creating a glue-like slime is difficult, but it can be achieved by devising ways to weaken the crosslinking reaction of borax.

## Required materials
If you can prepare pregelatinized potato starch:
- borax
- sodium sesquicarbonate or sodium bicarbonate
- glucose or sugar
- maltodextrin
- pregelatinized potato starch
- PVA

If you can't prepare pregelatinized potato starch:
- borax
- sodium sesquicarbonate or sodium bicarbonate
- glucose or sugar
- potato starch
- PVA

## How to make
If you can prepare pregelatinized potato starch:
1. Prepare borax, sodium sesquicarbonate or sodium bicarbonate, glucose or sugar, maltodextrin, and pregelatinized potato starch in a ratio of 1:3:6:70:120.
2. Prepare a powder mixture containing all materials except borax.
3. Pour 5 times the amount of water as the powder mixture into a bucket, then add the powder mixture while stirring the water.
4. Add an appropriate amount of 10% PVA solution.
5. Add an appropriate amount of 2% borax solution.

If you can't prepare pregelatinized potato starch:
1. Prepare borax, sodium sesquicarbonate or sodium bicarbonate, glucose or sugar and potato starch in a ratio of 1:3:6:120.
2. Pour 10 times the amount of water as the potato starch into a pot, then add the potato starch into it. Heat the water while stirring the water to gelatinize.
3. Add sodium sesquicarbonate or sodium bicarbonate, glucose or sugar to the starch solution.
4. Add an appropriate amount of 10% PVA solution.
5. Add an appropriate amount of 2% borax solution.
